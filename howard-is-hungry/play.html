      <h1>HOWARD IS HUNGRY!</h1>
      <p>The voracious sea turtle Howard has found a popular tourist-infested harbor.</p>
      <p>Delicious morsels of food are frequently tossed overboard -- but so are fishing lines with painful hooks!</p> 
      <p> <b>1P)</b> Try to eat as much food as you can before getting caught three times.</p>
      <p><b>2P)</b> Compete with Howard's sister Henrietta to eat more food in 
        a short period of time; </p>
      <p>points increase over time, but get caught and you'll lose (half) your lunch!</p>
      <p><b>Controls:</b> Arrow keys (Green Howard), WASD (Red Henrietta)
