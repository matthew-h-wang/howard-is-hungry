      <h1>HOWARD IS HUNGRY!</h1>
      <p>The voracious sea turtle Howard has found a popular tourist-infested harbor.
        Dropped food abounds, but so do fishing lines. 
        Try to eat as much food as you can before getting caught 3x, or compete 
        with Howard's sister Henrietta to eat more food (and get caught less) in 
        a short period of time.
      </p>
      <p><b>Controls:</b> Arrow keys (Green Howard), WASD (Red Henrietta)
