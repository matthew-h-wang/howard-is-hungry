      <h1>HOWARD IS HUNGRY!</h1>
      <p>The voracious sea turtle Howard has found a popular tourist-infested harbor.</p>
      <p>Delicious morsels of food dropped overboard, but so do fishing lines with painful hooks!</p> 
      <p>Try to eat as much food as you can before getting caught 3x.  </p>
      <p>Or compete with Howard's sister Henrietta to eat more food (and get caught less) in 
        a short period of time.</p>
      <p><b>Controls:</b> Arrow keys (Green Howard), WASD (Red Henrietta)
